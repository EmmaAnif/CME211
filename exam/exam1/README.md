Language Choice
1. Low level language because code needs to be optimized for performance
2. Low level language because code needs to be optimized for performance
3. High level language because it's easier to test and develop code with it
4. High level language because code doesn not do a lot of computation
5. Low level language because optimizing memory is key in embedded systems.

Conditionals
- The conditonals are supposed to test for the same call of random.random()
to get a correct distribution. However, random.random() is called twice 
which doesn't give the expected distribution.
A correct approach would have been to set testVal = random.random(). The 
conditional should then be tested on testVal.

Mutable or Immutable
The weevil datatype is mutable since its elements can be modified as shown 
in a[1] = 7 and b[-1] = "goodbye".
