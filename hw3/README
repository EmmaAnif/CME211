#Description of code design
The Airfoil class uses object oriented programming concepts to process data
associated with an airfoil.
The class has 6 methods that are used to interact with the input directory
and calling print on an instance of the class would return information
about the the lift coefficient and stagnation point for each angle of attack.

Key OOP concepts used include abstraction, decomposition and encapsulation.
Abstraction - An instance of the Airfoil class hides all the messy details 
about the data points and pressure coefficient while simply presenting the 
required information to the user.
Decomposition - The Airfoil class breaks down the long process of getting 
lift coefficient and stagnation point into smaller chunks using 6 different 
methods: __init__, load_alpha, calc_cl, load_xy, stag_pt and __str__
Encapsulation - The Airfoil class bundles within it all the data associiated 
with the class and methods that are used to interact with the data. This 
ensures that the main program is clean and easily readable.

#Description of error checking and exception generation
When an instance of the class is created, it checks to see if the input
directory exists otherwise, it returns an error. It also checks to see if xy
data points and pressure coefficient for each angle of attack exists otherwise,
it returns an error.
It raises an exception if it cannot open the files provided or if the angle of
attack used in naming the file is invalid (not a number).
