\noindent
The Truss class is used for loading and analyzing a 2D truss using the method
of joints.\\
It has 4 methods: __init__, PlotGeometry, SolveTruss, __repr__\\
\\
__init__ takes 3 inputs: an instance of the class, joints files and beams
files. It coverts these files to arrays suitable for use by other methods and
it also extracts some relevant data such as number of joints, beams and
rigid supports from the files. It has no return.\\
\\
PlotGeometry takes 2 inputs: an instance of the class and a plot filename. It
creates a matplotlib plot of the 2D truss geometry and saves it with the plot
filename given. It has no return.\\
\\
SolveTruss takes 1 input: an instance of the class. It analyzes the truss and
solves for the reaction forces in each beam. It uses a csr matrix to store the
equations as a sparse matrix. It has no return.\\
\\
__repr__ takes 1 input: an instance of the class. It returns a string
representation of the reaction forces in each beam.\\
