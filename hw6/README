This code implements a C++ image class that can read and write JPEG files and has
methods to compute the sharpness of the image and smooth(blur) the image using a
box blur kernel of a specified size.

The image class has a constructor that reads the file and stores the image data as
an attribute. It also has three methods used for analyzing the image.
1. Save() method writes the current version of the image to a JPEG file.
2. BoxBlur() method uses the convolution function to smooth the image with a kernel
of the given kernel size.
3. Sharpness() method computes the sharpness of the image

The Convolution function is used to compute the convolution of a given image array with
a kernel. It creates a buffer array that stores the input image array with the 4 sides
extended based on the kernel size then carries out the convolution computation with the
given kernel.

The main file reads the provided grayscale image and computes its sharpness.
It also blurs the image with successively larger box blur kernels (3,7,...,27),
outputs the blurred images as JPEG files and computes the sharpness of each blurry
version of the image.
